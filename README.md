# Kickstarter-Analysis

The Kickstarter data gave us an insight into different trends for different crowdfunding projects.  Throughout this module we were able to filter, organize, add and create visual representations of the data that was collected to help answer a few questions that we wanted to answer. At the end we were able to create visual representations on two important sets of data to help us understand more on what made a successful, failed or canceled crowdfunding project. With these visual representations we are able to clearly see why the outcomes of these crowdfunding projects were either successful or failed or canceled. 

A majority of these crowdfunding projects either failed or they were successful. Very little of these projects were canceled even though we only looked a few categories. For the first part of the challenge, we looked at the Outcomes based on launch date for the “Theater” parent category.

 Before we even created the pivot chart “Theater Outcomes based on launch date”, we were able to split the Category and subcategory column to help filter this data. After spilting the category and sub category column, we were able to create this pivot table. In this pivot table, we were able to take the number of successful, failed and canceled crowdfunding projects and make a visual representation to see what impact the launch date made on the outcome of the project. Looking at the “Theater” category, we can see that the most successful outcomes came between the months of April and August. The total number of successful outcomes between those months were 411 total successful. As the years went into the later months you can see that the number of successful outcomes steadily decreased. 
 
The reason could be as the years went into the later months, the amount that was being pledged was probably decreasing as well. Another observation that we can make from this pivot table is that the number of canceled crowdfunding projects were very minimal for this category. The highest number of canceled outcomes in the Theater parent category was 7 and that was in the month of January. Other than that, the number of canceled projects never exceeded 4. 

Some limitations of this dataset are that we aren’t seeing the outcomes of the other categories. If we are able to see the other categories successful, failed and canceled outcomes based on launch date we can definitively say that April thru August is the best time to start a project. If we were to go even further with that study, we could compare the launch date with the amount the backers pledged to see if there’s a certain time of year that projects are more likely to get funded. 

The next set of data we looked at was outcomes based on goals under the “plays” subcategory. In this dataset, we were able to look at the relationship between the outcome and the amount of the goal. To get to get to this data, we used the CountIf function to get the number of successful, failed and canceled projects for  twelve different dollar ranges of the “play” subcategory.

One thing I found interesting looking at the number of projects in this category is as the goal dollar amount went up, the number of projects decreased. The total projects after $15000 went down. That brings me to conclude that this category could be one of the least expensive to fund. As the dollar amount increased , the number of people to back the projects was likely to decrease. As we can see in this chart, the most percentage failed projects in the play category are under the goal range of $45000 to $49999 goal range. We can also see that the biggest percentage successful projects were in the goal range of $1000. As the dollar amount range went up the, number of successful projects went down. This could lead us to conclude that the amount pledged for this category was most likely being cut as the dollar amount increased. However, starting at the $25000 plus mark, we do see an increase in the percentage of successful outcomes but the total number of projects is very little. Once the goaled reach the $40000 mark, we see a sharp decline in successful projects and we see a sharp increase in the number of failed projects and where these numbers will stay in our final observation of the data. One final observation that I see is that there are no canceled projects. This is interesting because this tells me that people really enjoy plays and didn’t want to cancel the funding, they and wanted to see them successful. 

Limitations with this data again is that we are only testing one subcategory. If we were to compare the “play” subcategory with a different or multiple subcategories, we could then conclude for certain that the “play” subcategory is one of the least expensive. One way we could go further into this study is if we were able to take the goal amounts of the other subcategories and plug the numbers into the same chart to compare and contrast subcategories goals success rate.  That could give us a sense of what the most popular subcategory would be. 

As we worked through the data set, we were able to conclude that the most successful times of year to try to launch a theater project is starting in April and starting no later than august. Its easy to see the increase and the decline points on the graph. For the second observation, we can see that as the dollar amount started below $1000, most of the projects were successful. As the amount of the project goal increased, the percentage of failed projects increased except for a little increase after the goal amount of $25000 but the total number of projects was very minimal.
